# Troubleshooting & Debugging

When a download fails, a service misbehaves, or a key won't resolve, evied gives you three tools to find out why:

- **Debug logging**: verbose `DEBUG`-level console output plus a structured, machine-readable log file.
- **[`evied env`](#checking-your-environment)**: verify that the external tools evied depends on are installed, and see exactly which directories and config file are in use.
- **Targeted toggles**: `debug_keys` and `debug_requests` for the two areas (DRM keys and raw HTTP traffic) that are deliberately quiet by default.

The sections below cover how to enable each of them, how to read what they produce, and which diagnostic fits which failure mode.

---

## Turning on debug logging

There are two independent ways to enable debug logging, and they do slightly different things.

=== "The `-d` / `--debug` flag"

    The root-level flag turns on verbose logging for a single invocation:

    ```console
    evied -d dl SERVICE TITLE_ID
    ```

    It must come **before** the subcommand, because it is an option on the root `evied` command, not on `dl`.

    `-d` does three things:

    1. Sets the console log level to `DEBUG`, so every module logs its full detail.
    2. Enables the structured JSON debug log file (see [below](#the-structured-json-debug-log)).
    3. Adds source-path annotations to console log lines (which file and line each message came from).

=== "The `debug` config key"

    To make debug logging the default for every run without typing `-d` each time, set it in your `evied.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    debug: true
    ```

    or via the [`cfg`](cli-reference.md#cfg) command:

    ```console
    evied cfg debug true
    ```

    !!! note "`debug: true` is not identical to `-d`"
        The `debug` config key enables the **JSON debug log file**, but it does **not** raise the console to `DEBUG` level and does not add source-path annotations. Those only happen when you pass the `-d` flag. Use the flag when you want to *watch* the verbose output live; use the config key when you just want the log file written every time. Passing `-d` is the most complete option, and you can combine both.

!!! warning "Debug logging can be noisy and revealing"
    Debug output is verbose and includes request metadata, service internals, and stack traces. Secrets, URLs, and local paths are automatically redacted (see [Redaction](#what-gets-redacted)), but you should still glance over a log before sharing it publicly.

---

## The structured JSON debug log

Beyond the console output, evied writes a structured log in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format: one complete JSON object per line. This file is designed to be filtered, searched, and analysed with standard tooling (`jq`, `grep`, a text editor), and it is safe to attach to a bug report because it is redacted.

### Where it is written

The debug log is created during a `dl` run (and by [`import`](cli-reference.md#import), which wraps `dl`). The path is:

```
<logs directory>/evied_debug_<service>_<timestamp>.jsonl
```

For example, `evied_debug_EXAMPLE_20260703-142530.jsonl`. The `<service>` tag and the timestamp mean each download gets its own file, so runs never overwrite each other.

!!! tip "Find your logs directory"
    The logs directory defaults to a `logs` folder inside the package data directory, but it can be relocated with the `directories.logs` config key. To see the exact resolved path on your machine, run [`evied env info`](#env-info) and read the **Directories** table.

### What a log entry looks like

Every line is a self-contained JSON object. The first line of a session records the environment:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-07-03T14:25:30.123456+00:00","session_id":"a1b2c3d4","level":"INFO","operation":"session_start","message":"Debug logging session started","context":{"evied_version":"5.3.0","python_version":"3.12.4 ...","platform":"Linux-6.18.5-x86_64","platform_system":"Linux","platform_release":"6.18.5"}}
```

Subsequent lines describe operations: service calls, DRM licence requests, vault lookups, downloader progress, and errors. Common fields include:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | UTC ISO-8601 time of the entry. |
| `session_id` | Short random ID shared by every entry in one run, handy for correlating lines. |
| `level` | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`. |
| `operation` | The action being logged, e.g. `service_call`, `download_init`, `drm_get_widevine_license`, `vault_get_key`, `session_end`. |
| `message` | Human-readable description (redacted). |
| `service` | Service tag the entry belongs to, when applicable. |
| `context` | Arbitrary structured detail for the operation. |
| `request` / `response` | HTTP method/URL and response metadata for network operations. |
| `duration_ms` | How long a timed operation took. |
| `success` | Whether the operation succeeded. |
| `error` | On failures: the exception `type`, `message`, and a full `traceback` array (all redacted). |

### Reading and filtering the log

Because each line is independent JSON, `jq` is the natural tool:

```console
# Show only error-level entries
jq 'select(.level == "ERROR")' evied_debug_EXAMPLE_20260703-142530.jsonl

# List every operation and whether it succeeded
jq -c '{operation, success}' evied_debug_EXAMPLE_20260703-142530.jsonl

# Pull the traceback out of the first error
jq -r 'select(.error) | .error.traceback[]' evied_debug_EXAMPLE_20260703-142530.jsonl

# Show only DRM / licensing operations
jq 'select(.operation | startswith("drm_"))' evied_debug_EXAMPLE_20260703-142530.jsonl
```

The session's binary-tool versions (Shaka Packager, mp4decrypt, mkvmerge, FFmpeg, FFprobe) are logged near the start of a `dl` run, which is often the fastest way to confirm a muxing or decryption failure is really a wrong-version problem.

---

## Debugging DRM keys with `debug_keys`

By default, content-decryption **keys are redacted** in the JSON debug log. Any field that looks like a key is written as `[REDACTED]`. This keeps logs shareable. When you are specifically debugging a key-retrieval or decryption problem and need to see the actual KID/KEY values that were fetched, enable `debug_keys`:

```yaml
debug_keys: true
```

```console
evied cfg debug_keys true
```

With `debug_keys: true`, the debug log stops masking key fields, so you can confirm which keys came back from a licence server or vault and compare them against what decryption expected.

!!! warning "Keys are sensitive, turn this back off"
    `debug_keys` writes real decryption keys into the log file in cleartext. Only enable it while actively diagnosing a key issue, never share a log produced with it on, and set it back to `false` when you're done. Note that `debug_keys` only affects the **JSON debug log file**. It does not change what the console prints.

Fields that are *always* redacted regardless of `debug_keys` (anything whose name contains `password`, `token`, `secret`, `auth`, or `cookie`) stay masked, so credentials never leak even in a keys-on log.

---

## Debugging HTTP traffic with `debug_requests`

When you pass `-d`, evied raises its own modules to `DEBUG` but deliberately **silences** the noisy low-level HTTP libraries (`urllib3`, `requests`, `rnet`, `httpx`, `httpcore`, `hpack`, `h2`) back down to `WARNING`. Without this, a single download would bury the useful output under thousands of connection-pool and HTTP/2 frame messages.

If you need that low-level traffic (for example when a request is failing at the TLS or connection layer and you need to see the underlying library's own logs), enable `debug_requests`:

```yaml
debug_requests: true
```

```console
evied cfg debug_requests true
```

With `debug_requests: true`, those libraries are left at `DEBUG` level when you run with `-d`, so their request/response chatter appears in the console.

!!! note "`debug_requests` needs `-d` to have any effect"
    The `debug_requests` toggle only decides whether the HTTP libraries are silenced when the `-d` flag is active. If you are not running with `-d` (verbose console logging), it changes nothing. Combine them: `evied -d dl ...` with `debug_requests: true` in config.

---

## What gets redacted

evied redacts logged strings so that debug output is safe to share. Three passes are applied to every logged message, error, and structured value:

- **Secrets**: passwords, tokens, API secrets, auth values, and cookies are replaced with `[REDACTED]`.
- **URLs**: every `http(s)` URL is collapsed to `redacted` (keeping only the file extension, so a manifest still shows as `redacted.mpd` and a segment as `redacted.m4s`). This hides content, CDN, manifest, and licence-server locations while preserving the *type* of resource.
- **Local paths**: install-root, virtualenv, and home-directory prefixes are replaced with tokens, so your username and machine layout don't appear in logs.

Path redaction is controlled by the `redact_paths` config key, which is **on by default**:

```yaml
redact_paths: true   # default - mask local base directories in logged paths
```

Set `redact_paths: false` if you are debugging a path problem locally and want to see full, unmasked paths in the console and logs. Secret and URL redaction in the JSON debug log are always applied and are not affected by this toggle.

---

## Checking your environment

Many "download failed" problems are really missing external tools or a config file that isn't where you think it is. The [`evied env`](cli-reference.md#env) command group answers both questions before you dig into logs.

### `env check`

`evied env check` verifies every external binary evied can use and prints a table of what's installed:

```console
evied env check
```

It reports each tool's status (`✓` installed / `✗` missing), whether it is **required** or optional, and what it's for. A summary line tells you the installed-vs-total count and, if anything mandatory is absent, exactly which required tools are missing.

The required tools (evied will not get far without them) are:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **FFmpeg** | Media processing |
| **FFprobe** | Media analysis |
| **MKVToolNix** (`mkvmerge`) | MKV muxing |
| **mkvpropedit** | MKV metadata |
| **Shaka Packager** | DRM decryption |

Optional tools unlock extra capabilities. For example, `mp4decrypt` (alternative decryptor), `dovi_tool` / `HDR10Plus_tool` (Dolby Vision / HDR10+), `SubtitleEdit` / `CCExtractor` (subtitle conversion and CC extraction), `MPV` / `FFplay` (playback preview), and `git` (service repositories) or `docker` (Gluetun VPN, see [Proxies & VPN](proxies-and-vpn.md)).

!!! tip "First thing to run when something breaks"
    If a decryption step errors, a mux fails, or a Dolby Vision title won't process, run `evied env check` first. A red `✗` next to the relevant tool is the answer far more often than a bug in evied.

### `env info`

`evied env info` shows where evied is reading configuration from and where every working directory lives:

```console
evied env info
```

- If a config file was found, it prints the path it was **loaded from**. If none was found, it lists every location it *would* accept one (see [Config file discovery](#why-is-my-config-not-being-picked-up) below), so you can create the file in the right place.
- It then prints a **Directories** table for every configured path: `downloads`, `temp`, `cache`, `cookies`, `logs`, `exports`, `wvds`, `prds`, the `services` search paths, and more.

This is the authoritative way to answer "where are my logs / downloads / cookies actually going?" The defaults are relative to the installed package, and any `directories:` overrides in your config are reflected here.

### `env clear`

Stale cache or leftover temp files can cause confusing behaviour (an old cached title list, a half-written temp file). `env clear` wipes those directories safely:

```console
evied env clear cache            # clear the whole cache directory
evied env clear cache EXAMPLE    # clear just one service's cache subdirectory
evied env clear temp             # clear the temp working directory
```

Each command reports how many files it removed and how much space it freed, then recreates the empty directory.

!!! tip "Cache-related weirdness"
    If a service keeps returning stale titles or metadata even after the source changed, clear that service's cache with `evied env clear cache <SERVICE>`. See [Vaults](vaults.md) for the separate, persistent key-vault store, which `env clear` does **not** touch.

---

## Common failure modes and how to inspect them

!!! example "A required tool is missing"
    **Symptom:** decryption, muxing, or analysis fails early, sometimes with a "binary not found" style error.

    **Inspect:** run `evied env check` and look for a red `✗` on a **required** row. Install the missing tool and re-run.

!!! example "Decryption produces garbage or fails"
    **Symptom:** the download completes but the file won't play, or the decrypt step errors.

    **Inspect:** enable `debug_keys` and run with `-d`, then check the JSON debug log's `drm_*` and `vault_*` operations to confirm which keys were fetched and from where. Also confirm Shaka Packager (or `mp4decrypt`) shows a sane version in the `download_init` binary-versions entry. See [DRM & CDM](drm-and-cdm.md).

!!! example "A network request fails at the connection or TLS layer"
    **Symptom:** timeouts, connection resets, or handshake errors that evied's own logs don't fully explain.

    **Inspect:** set `debug_requests: true` and run with `-d` to surface the underlying `urllib3` / `rnet` / `httpx` logs. In the JSON debug log, filter for `service_call` operations to see which request failed. If a proxy is involved, cross-check [Proxies & VPN](proxies-and-vpn.md).

!!! example "The wrong titles/metadata keep coming back"
    **Symptom:** a service returns outdated titles even after the source changed.

    **Inspect:** the title cache is likely serving stale data. Clear it with `evied env clear cache <SERVICE>`, or bypass it for one run using the `dl` no-cache / reset-cache options (see [Downloading](downloading.md) and the [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md#dl)).

!!! example "A config value doesn't seem to apply"
    **Symptom:** a setting you edited has no effect.

    **Inspect:** run `evied env info` to confirm **which** config file is actually loaded, and `evied cfg --list` to dump the effective values. It's common to edit a config file in a location evied isn't reading from. See below.

---

## Why is my config not being picked up?

evied loads the **first** `evied.yaml` it finds, in this order:

1. `evied.yaml` inside the package's namespace directory.
2. `evied.yaml` in the parent of that directory.
3. `evied.yaml` in your OS user-config directory: on Linux `~/.config/evied/evied.yaml`, on Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\evied\evied.yaml`, on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/evied/evied.yaml`.

If you have config in more than one of these, an earlier one wins and your edits to a later file are silently ignored. `evied env info` prints the path that was actually loaded (or, if none exists, lists all three candidate locations so you can create the file correctly). See [Configuration](cli-reference.md#cfg) for editing values with the `cfg` command.

---

!!! note "Developer note: structured logging in code"
    Service and command code emits entries through the shared `log_event(...)` helper (and the `timed_operation(...)` context manager for timing a block) from `evied.core.utilities`. These are no-ops when debug logging is disabled, so they are always safe to leave in place. When adding a new feature, call `log_event("my_feature_event", message="...", context={...})` rather than reimplementing the "is the logger enabled?" guard. The redaction and JSON-serialisation are handled for you, and any field whose name looks like a key/secret/token is redacted automatically (keys only appear when the run has `debug_keys` enabled).

### Logging conventions when adding entries

The debug log is tuned for **developers troubleshooting pipeline flow** (maximum signal, minimum noise), not for end users. A few conventions keep it that way. They are not enforced by the `log_event` signature, so they are easy to miss and worth stating explicitly.

!!! tip "Log levels are a flow skeleton, not just severity"
    Treat `level` as structure, not decoration. Emit exactly **one `INFO` milestone per pipeline stage** so that `jq 'select(.level=="INFO")'` reads back the whole end-to-end flow of a run. Everything internal goes to `DEBUG`; failures go to `ERROR`. Keeping `INFO` sparse is the whole point. It is the line a developer skims first to see where a run got to before it broke.

    ```console
    # Read the pipeline's high-level flow, one line per stage
    jq 'select(.level == "INFO")' evied_debug_EXAMPLE_20260703-142530.jsonl
    ```

!!! warning "No raw dumps"
    Never log a full `Tracks` object, an MPD/manifest body, or a response payload. Log only **counts, ids, sizes, and `safe_display_url(url)`**. This keeps the log low-noise and prevents leaking content or manifest data into the file *before* redaction even runs. Redaction is a backstop, not a licence to dump raw objects.

!!! note "Operation names: `<area>_<event>`, no registry"
    Operation names are plain lowercase strings following an `<area>_<event>` convention: `manifest_dash_parse`, `drm_decrypt`, `vault_get_key`, `tool_run`. They are written inline at each call site on purpose: there is **no central registry or enum**, and you should not go hunting for one or create one. The absence is a deliberate design choice, not an omission.

!!! note "Message reads alone; data lives in fields"
    Give every entry a single-sentence `message` that stands on its own, and put all structured data (`context`, counts, ids, `duration_ms`) in **fields** rather than baking it into the prose. This separation is what lets the log be both human-scannable and machine-filterable; a message like `"Parsed DASH manifest"` with `context={"video": 4, "audio": 2}` beats `"Parsed manifest with 4 video and 2 audio tracks"`.

!!! tip "Let tool runs log themselves"
    For external-tool calls (FFmpeg, mkvmerge, `dovi_tool`, and friends), route through `run_step` / `ffprobe`, which auto-emit a `tool_run` entry capturing the binary's version, return code, and duration consistently. Only fall back to calling `log_tool_run` manually for a direct `subprocess.run` you genuinely can't route through `run_step`. Auto-logging is the preferred path precisely because it captures those fields the same way every time.
