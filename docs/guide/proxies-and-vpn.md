# Proxies & VPN

Most streaming services are geo-restricted, region-priced, or simply refuse to hand
over a manifest from the "wrong" country. evied routes its traffic through a proxy
so the service sees the location you choose instead of your own. You can point it at a
single proxy URL, or configure one of several **proxy providers** (commercial VPNs and
self-hosted tunnels), then ask for a country by its two-letter code and let
evied pick a working server for you.

The `--proxy` flag controls proxying, and a query is resolved to a real proxy URL by the
providers evied supports: [basic static proxies](#basic-static-proxies),
[Gluetun](#gluetun) (documented in the most detail, since it is the most flexible),
[ExpressVPN](#expressvpn), [NordVPN](#nordvpn), [Proton VPN](#proton-vpn),
[Hola](#hola), [Surfshark](#surfshark), and [Windscribe](#windscribe).

!!! note "Where proxies are configured"
    All provider configuration lives under the top-level `proxy_providers:` key in your
    `evied.yaml`. Each provider has its own sub-key, and the keys inside it map
    directly onto that provider's settings. See the
    [Configuration file](../getting-started/configuration-file.md) page for where the
    file lives and how it is loaded.

## The `--proxy` flag

Proxying is controlled at download time by three options on the `dl` command:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--proxy` | The proxy to use. Either an explicit URI, or a query that evied resolves against your configured providers. |
| `--no-proxy` | Force **all** proxy use off. No providers are initialised and no proxy query is resolved. |
| `--no-proxy-download` | Use the proxy for the manifest, licence, and authentication, but bypass it for the **segment downloads** themselves. |

```shell title="Explicit proxy URI"
evied dl --proxy http://user:pass@1.2.3.4:8080 EXAMPLE 81234567
```

```shell title="Resolve a US server from your configured providers"
evied dl --proxy us EXAMPLE 81234567
```

```shell title="Target a specific provider"
evied dl --proxy nordvpn:us EXAMPLE 81234567
```

!!! tip "Set a default proxy in config"
    Like every `dl` flag, `--proxy` can be given a default in your configuration so you
    do not have to pass it on every command. See
    [Downloading](downloading.md) for how `dl` options and config defaults interact.

### `--no-proxy-download`

Segment downloads are usually the largest share of traffic, and a residential-grade VPN
proxy is often the slowest link in the chain. `--no-proxy-download` lets you keep the
proxy where it matters (passing the geo-check for the manifest and the licence) while
pulling the actual audio and video segments over your normal connection for full speed.

```shell title="Proxy the manifest and licence, download segments direct"
evied dl --proxy gb --no-proxy-download EXAMPLE 10a1234
```

!!! warning "When this is unsafe"
    Some services tie segment delivery (CDN tokens, per-segment geo-checks) to the same
    region as the manifest. On those services, bypassing the proxy for downloads will
    cause segment fetches to fail or return the wrong region. If downloads break with
    `--no-proxy-download`, remove it.

## How proxy resolution works

The value you pass to `--proxy` is interpreted in one of three ways. evied checks
them in order.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["--proxy value"] --> B{"Looks like a URI?<br/>http:// https:// socks"}
    B -- yes --> C["Use it verbatim"]
    B -- no --> D{"Has a provider prefix?<br/>provider:query"}
    D -- yes --> E["Ask that one provider<br/>for the query"]
    D -- no --> F["Ask every provider in order,<br/>first match wins"]
```

1. **An explicit URI.** Anything shaped like `http://...`, `https://...`, or a `socks...`
   URI is used exactly as given. evied logs `Using explicit Proxy: ...` and does no
   lookup.
2. **A provider-prefixed query**: `provider:query`, for example `nordvpn:us` or
   `gluetun:windscribe:us`. evied finds the provider whose name matches the prefix
   (case-insensitive) and asks *only* that provider to resolve the remainder. If no such
   provider is loaded, or it returns no proxy, the download errors.
3. **A bare query**: a region like `us`, `gb`, `us:seattle`, or `us1234`. evied
   asks each loaded provider **in order** and uses the first proxy any of them returns.

The query is matched against a region grammar (a two-letter country code, optionally
followed by a server number and/or a `:city` or `-city` part), lowercased, and then
handed to the provider. The exact forms each provider accepts are documented in its
section below.

### Provider load order

When you run a download without `--no-proxy`, evied instantiates every configured
provider once, in this fixed order, and that same order is used for bare-query
resolution:

**Basic → ExpressVPN → NordVPN → Proton VPN → Surfshark → Windscribe → Gluetun → Hola**

So if you have both Basic and NordVPN configured and run `--proxy us`, a `us` entry in
your Basic config wins because Basic is tried first. To skip ahead to a specific
provider, prefix the query (`--proxy nordvpn:us`).

!!! note "Auto-loading providers"
    Most providers only load when you configure them under `proxy_providers:`. Three are
    special: **ExpressVPN** and **Proton VPN** also load automatically once their cached
    session file exists on disk (even with no YAML), and **Hola** loads automatically
    whenever the `hola-proxy` binary is found on your `PATH`.

### Connection feedback

After a provider resolves a query, evied prints a line so you can confirm
where you came out:

- **Gluetun** reports the verified exit IP, country, and city of the container.
- **ExpressVPN** and **Proton VPN** print a location summary such as
  `(USA - New York, #3 of 5): .214`.
- Other providers log the resolved proxy URL.

## Basic (static proxies)

The `Basic` provider is pure static configuration, with no accounts and no network calls. You
list proxy URLs per country code, and evied serves them back when you query that
country. This is the right choice when you already have proxy endpoints (from a proxy
seller, your own servers, or a corporate gateway).

Under each two-letter country code you can put either a single proxy string or a list of
them:

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
proxy_providers:
  basic:
    us: http://user:pass@1.2.3.4:8080
    de:
      - http://a.example:8080
      - socks5://b.example:1080
```

**Query forms:**

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `us` | A proxy for the US. If several are listed, one is chosen at random. |
| `us2` | The **2nd** entry in the US list (1-based). |

- If a country has a single proxy string, that proxy is always returned.
- If it has a list and you give a plain country code, one is picked at random; append an
  index (`de1`, `de2`) to pin a specific entry.
- Each URL is normalised (a missing scheme defaults to `http`) and validated, so a
  malformed URI is rejected up front rather than failing mid-download.

```shell
evied dl --proxy de2 EXAMPLE 81234567
```

## Gluetun

Gluetun is evied's most flexible proxy backend, and the one to reach for if you want
one configuration to cover many VPN providers. Instead of returning a remote proxy URL,
Gluetun **launches a local Docker container** running the
[`qmcgaw/gluetun`](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun) image. That container establishes a
WireGuard or OpenVPN tunnel to your chosen VPN provider and exposes a plain HTTP proxy on
`localhost`, which evied then routes traffic through. When the download finishes, the
container is torn down automatically.

This means you get access to the **50+ VPN providers** that Gluetun supports, using your own
VPN subscription, through a single uniform interface, with no per-provider integration
in evied itself.

!!! warning "Docker is required"
    Gluetun needs a working [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installation on
    your `PATH`. If Docker is not found, the provider fails to load with an error linking
    to the install docs. The container also needs the `NET_ADMIN` capability and access
    to `/dev/net/tun` to bring up the tunnel. evied requests both automatically.

### Query format

Gluetun uses a nested selector: the provider prefix picks Gluetun, and the rest names the
**VPN provider** and the **region**.

```
gluetun:<vpn-provider>:<region>
```

```shell title="A Windscribe US exit via Gluetun"
evied dl --proxy gluetun:windscribe:us EXAMPLE 81234567
```

```shell title="A NordVPN Germany exit via Gluetun"
evied dl --proxy gluetun:nordvpn:de EXAMPLE 81234567
```

After evied strips the leading `gluetun:`, the provider receives exactly
`provider:region` (two colon-separated parts; anything else is an error). The
`<vpn-provider>` must be one you have configured under `gluetun.providers`, and friendly
names are normalised to Gluetun's identifiers (for example `pia` and
`privateinternetaccess` both map to `private internet access`).

### Configuration

Each VPN provider you want to use gets an entry under `providers:`, carrying its VPN type,
credentials, and how your region aliases map onto Gluetun's server selectors.

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
proxy_providers:
  gluetun:
    providers:
      windscribe:
        vpn_type: wireguard
        credentials:
          private_key: YOUR_WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY
          addresses: YOUR_WIREGUARD_ADDRESS
          preshared_key: YOUR_PRESHARED_KEY
        server_countries:
          us: US
          uk: GB
        server_cities: {}
        server_hostnames: {}
        extra_env: {}
      nordvpn:
        vpn_type: wireguard
        credentials:
          private_key: YOUR_WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY
        server_countries:
          us: US
          de: DE

    # Global settings (all optional)
    base_port: 8888
    auto_cleanup: true
    container_prefix: evied-gluetun
    auth_user: null
    auth_password: null
    verify_ip: true
```

**Per-provider keys:**

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `vpn_type` | `wireguard` (default) or `openvpn`. |
| `credentials` | The secrets for the tunnel; see the credential rules below. |
| `server_countries` | Maps your region alias (e.g. `us`) to Gluetun's country value (e.g. `US`). |
| `server_cities` | Optional. Maps an alias to a Gluetun city. |
| `server_hostnames` | Optional. Maps an alias directly to a specific server hostname. |
| `extra_env` | Optional. Raw environment variables merged into the container last, for any Gluetun setting not covered above. |

**Credential rules by VPN type:**

=== "WireGuard"

    - `private_key` is **always** required.
    - `surfshark`, `mullvad`, and `ivpn` also require `addresses`.
    - `windscribe` additionally requires **both** `addresses` and `preshared_key`
      (`preshared_key` may be an empty string, but the key must be present).
    - NordVPN and Proton VPN need only `private_key`.

=== "OpenVPN"

    - Requires `username` and `password`.

!!! tip "Which `vpn_type` should I pick?"
    WireGuard is the default because it **can be faster**, but it needs the fiddlier
    credential setup above (private keys, and for some providers `addresses` and a
    preshared key). OpenVPN is the **simplest** to configure (just a username and
    password) at the cost of some speed. If you are getting started or hitting credential
    trouble, OpenVPN is the path of least resistance; switch to WireGuard when you want the
    extra throughput.

**Global keys:**

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `base_port` | `8888` | The first local port to expose proxies on. Additional containers take the next free ports. |
| `auto_cleanup` | `true` | Remove containers on exit. If `false`, containers are only stopped, not deleted. |
| `container_prefix` | `evied-gluetun` | Prefix for Docker container names. |
| `auth_user` / `auth_password` | `null` | Optional HTTP-proxy credentials. If set, the local proxy requires auth and the credentials are embedded in the proxy URL. |
| `verify_ip` | `true` | After connecting, verify the container's real exit IP and region. |

### Region selection

For a given query region, Gluetun resolves the server like this:

1. An explicit entry in `server_hostnames`, `server_cities`, or `server_countries` for
   that alias always wins.
2. A `us1239`-style query (country code + number) with no explicit mapping is turned
   into a provider-specific server hostname (for example `us1239.nordvpn.com` for
   NordVPN, `us-1239.prod.surfshark.com` for Surfshark).
3. A bare two-letter code is expanded to the full country name Gluetun expects.

A few providers (Windscribe, VyprVPN, VPN Secure) select by **region** rather than
country, and Windscribe region names are translated automatically. For instance `us`
becomes `US East` and `uk`/`gb` become `United Kingdom`.

### Container lifecycle

Understanding what Gluetun does behind the scenes helps when something goes wrong:

1. **Image check.** `qmcgaw/gluetun:latest` is pulled if it is not already present.
2. **Reuse.** If a container for this exact `provider:region` is already running (from a
   concurrent evied session), it is adopted instead of starting a new one. Stopped or
   dead containers with the same name are pruned first.

!!! note "Expect a slow first request, then instant reuse"
    Bringing up a fresh tunnel takes roughly **10 to 30 seconds** for the first request to a
    given `provider:region`. This is the VPN handshake and readiness wait, not a hang.
    Every subsequent request that reuses that same container is effectively **instant**. A
    slow first run is normal.
3. **Port allocation.** A free local port is chosen starting from `base_port`.
4. **Start.** The container is launched bound to `127.0.0.1:{port}`. Credentials are
   passed through a temporary, `0600`-permission env-file (never as `-e` flags), which is
   overwritten and deleted immediately after.
5. **Readiness wait.** evied polls the container logs (up to 60 seconds) until both
   the HTTP proxy is listening **and** the VPN reports a completed connection. Fatal
   errors like `authentication failed` or `invalid credentials` abort early, and recent
   logs are attached to the error to help you diagnose it.
6. **IP verification.** When `verify_ip` is on, evied queries the container's exit IP
   and checks the country matches what you asked for, raising a *region mismatch* error if
   it does not.
7. **Proxy handed back.** You get `http://localhost:{port}` (or with auth credentials if
   configured).

!!! note "Cleanup and Ctrl+C"
    Containers are cleaned up via an `atexit` handler on normal exit. Gluetun deliberately
    does **not** install its own signal handlers, so `Ctrl+C` continues to work as you
    expect. If a run is killed hard (e.g. `kill -9`) a container can be left behind; with
    `auto_cleanup: true` the next run adopting that name will still work, or you can remove
    it manually with `docker rm -f`.

### Troubleshooting

!!! example "Common Gluetun issues"
    - **`RuntimeError` about Docker not found.** Install Docker and confirm `docker` is
      on your `PATH`.
    - **`invalid credentials` / `authentication failed` in the readiness wait.** Your
      WireGuard/OpenVPN credentials are wrong or in the wrong fields. Double-check
      `private_key`, `addresses`, and (for Windscribe) `preshared_key`.
    - **Region mismatch error.** The VPN connected but exited in a different country than
      requested. Check your `server_countries` mapping, or set `verify_ip: false` if you
      are intentionally using a nearby region.
    - **Timeout after 60 seconds.** The tunnel never came up. Inspect the container logs
      (`docker logs <container>`) for the underlying VPN error.

## ExpressVPN

ExpressVPN mirrors the ExpressVPN Android TV app: it signs in through Express's OAuth 2.0
device-login flow, obtains proxy-capable locations from Express's API, and returns an
authenticated HTTPS proxy. The device login runs once; after that the cached refresh token
keeps the session alive headlessly.

Enable it and run a download interactively once:

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
proxy_providers:
  expressvpn:
    enable: true
```

With `enable: true` and an interactive terminal, evied prints a code and a URL to
enter it at. Once approved, the tokens are cached and reused automatically, so later runs
need no terminal. ExpressVPN also **auto-loads** once its token cache exists, so you can
drop `enable` after the first login, but you can keep a YAML block to pin regions or
servers:

```yaml title="evied.yaml (optional)"
proxy_providers:
  expressvpn:
    region_map:
      us: ny-02       # prefer New York, server 02 for the US
      gb:             # empty = smart random location
    server_map:
      myserver: usny-newyork-2
```

**Default file location:**

| File | Default path |
|---|---|
| Token cache | `{cache}/vpn/expressvpn_tokens.json` |

Where `{cache}` is your configured cache directory.

**Query forms:**

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `us` | A smart, random US location. |
| `us-ny` | US, New York. |
| `us-ny-2` / `us-ny2` | US, New York, the 2nd server. |
| `usny-newyork-2` | A full location slug. |
| `hostname.expressprovider.com` | A direct endpoint hostname. |

The resolved proxy is an HTTPS proxy on port `443`. On success, evied prints a
location summary such as `(USA - New York, #3 of 5): .214`.

!!! note "Cache safety"
    ExpressVPN's token cache is written with `0600` permissions so the refresh token is
    never briefly world-readable.

## NordVPN

NordVPN uses your **Service Credentials**, not your normal NordVPN login. Generate them
from the [NordVPN dashboard](https://my.nordaccount.com/dashboard/nordvpn/) under manual
setup; they are a long random username/password pair, not your email and password.

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
proxy_providers:
  nordvpn:
    username: YOUR_SERVICE_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_SERVICE_PASSWORD
    server_map:                # optional: pin specific server IDs
      us: 1234
      us:seattle: 5678
```

**Required keys:** `username`, `password`. evied validates them up front: the
combined username and password must be exactly 48 alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive), and
the username must not contain an `@`. If validation fails, you have almost certainly used
your login credentials instead of your service credentials.

`server_map` is optional and maps a region (or `code:city`) to a pinned NordVPN server ID.
Its main use is tuning: for a given streaming service one specific server often performs
noticeably better than NordVPN's recommended pick, so hard-coding that server for a day or
two is a handy workaround until it degrades and you swap in another.

!!! note "Use `gb`, not `uk`, for the United Kingdom"
    Query the UK as `gb`. evied uses the Alpha-2 country code `gb` deliberately to stay
    consistent with its other regional/country-code systems and avoid the language-vs-
    country-code confusion that `uk` invites.

**Query forms:**

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `us` | A recommended US server. |
| `us1234` | The specific server `us1234`. |
| `us:seattle` | A recommended server in Seattle. |
| `228` | A NordVPN numeric country ID. |

The returned proxy is HTTPS on **port 89** (NordVPN disabled its plain-HTTP proxies on
port 80 in 2021).

```shell
evied dl --proxy nordvpn:us:seattle EXAMPLE 81234567
```

## Proton VPN

Proton VPN supports two authentication methods, and evied can work with either. Note
that free Proton accounts work but are limited to Proton's free-tier exit countries.

=== "TV login (recommended)"

    A self-sustaining, refreshable session obtained through Proton's TV device-login flow.
    This is the only method that can refresh itself headlessly, so it keeps working without
    re-exporting anything. Enable it and run a download interactively once:

    ```yaml title="evied.yaml"
    proxy_providers:
      protonvpn:
        enable: true
    ```

    With `enable: true` and an interactive terminal, evied prints a code and asks you
    to enter it at [account.proton.me/vpn/tv/code](https://account.proton.me/vpn/tv/code).
    Once approved, the session is cached and reused automatically.

=== "Exported cookies"

    Export your `account.proton.me` session cookies (the `AUTH-<UID>` cookie) to the Proton
    cookie file. This method is **access-only**: it cannot refresh, so you must re-export
    when it expires.

    !!! warning "The `AUTH-<UID>` cookie is HttpOnly"
        This is the single most common cause of a failed Proton cookie import: the required
        `AUTH-<UID>` cookie is **HttpOnly**, and many one-click cookie-export extensions
        silently skip HttpOnly cookies by default. If your import "doesn't work," use an
        exporter that explicitly includes HttpOnly cookies.

    !!! note "Why this session can't refresh, and lapses after ~24h"
        Proton rotates browser refresh tokens and ties them to the live browser, so a
        headless refresh is impossible. evied therefore deliberately uses only the
        cookie's short-lived **access token** and never attempts a refresh, which is why the
        session lapses at Proton's ~24h TTL and must be re-exported. This is exactly why TV
        login is preferred for set-and-forget use.

**Default file locations:**

| File | Default path |
|---|---|
| Cookies | `{cookies}/vpn/protonvpn.txt` |
| Session cache | `{cache}/vpn/protonvpn.json` |

Proton VPN **auto-loads** if its cookie file exists. Like ExpressVPN, its cached session
is written with `0600` permissions.

!!! note "Cache vs cookie precedence"
    If both a TV-login cache and a cookie file exist, the **cache is preferred** unless the
    cookie file is newer. Cookies are read fresh every run and never written back to the
    cache. So to deliberately force use of the cookie session, just re-save (re-export) the
    cookie file so its modification time is newer than the cache.

**Query forms (after the `protonvpn:` prefix):**

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `us` | A random US server (paid tiers preferred over free). |
| `us12` | Proton US server #12. |
| `us:ny` | A server in New York. |

The returned proxy is HTTPS on **port 4443** (or **port 443** for Secure Core servers).
Secure Core and Tor servers are excluded from selection because they are too slow for a
plain proxy. On success, evied prints a summary such as `(Name - City): server-host`.

!!! tip "Proton server numbers aren't sequential"
    When pinning a server with `protonvpn:deNN`, don't guess a low number. A country may
    expose non-contiguous IDs like `#203`, `#813`, and so on. Copy the number from a
    previous run's log line (e.g. `DE#203`) instead.

## Hola

Hola requires no configuration at all. It uses the
[`hola-proxy`](https://github.com/Snawoot/hola-proxy) binary, and **auto-loads** whenever
that binary is found on your `PATH`. If you query Hola but the binary is missing, the
provider raises an error telling you to install it.

```shell title="Install hola-proxy, then just query a country"
evied dl --proxy hola:us EXAMPLE 81234567
```

**Query forms:** a two-letter country code (e.g. `us`, `gb`). evied asks `hola-proxy`
for available proxies in that country and picks one at random, returning an HTTP proxy.

!!! warning "Temporary bans"
    Hola's free tier can rate-limit or temporarily ban you if queried too aggressively. If
    you see a *temporary ban detected* error, wait before retrying. Hola currently uses
    only datacenter proxies.

## Surfshark

Surfshark, like NordVPN, uses **Service Credentials** rather than your login. Generate
them from the [Surfshark manual-setup page](https://my.surfshark.com/vpn/manual-setup/main/openvpn).

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
proxy_providers:
  surfsharkvpn:
    username: YOUR_SERVICE_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_SERVICE_PASSWORD
    server_map:                # optional
      us: 1234
```

**Required keys:** `username`, `password`, validated with the same 48-character rule as
NordVPN (combined username+password must be 48 alphanumeric characters, case-insensitive, no `@`).
`server_map` optionally pins server IDs per region.

**Query forms:**

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `us` | A random US server. |
| `us-bos` | A specific server. |
| `us:seattle` | A random server in Seattle. |

The returned proxy is HTTPS on **port 443**.

## Windscribe

Windscribe uses **Service Credentials** from its
[OpenVPN config page](https://windscribe.com/getconfig/openvpn). Only the presence of a
username and password is checked (there is no 48-character rule).

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
proxy_providers:
  windscribevpn:
    username: YOUR_SERVICE_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_SERVICE_PASSWORD
    server_map:                       # optional: alias -> hostname
      us: us-east.totallyacdn.com
      us:seattle: us-seattle.totallyacdn.com
```

**Required keys:** `username`, `password`. `server_map` optionally maps a region (or
`region:city`) directly to a hostname.

**Query forms:**

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `us` | A random US server. |
| `us150` / `sg007` | A specific numbered server. |
| `us:seattle` | A random server in Seattle. |

The returned proxy is HTTPS on **port 443**.

!!! warning "Windscribe is not loaded by the REST API resolver"
    The standalone Windscribe provider (and Gluetun) are loaded by the `dl` command, but
    **not** by the proxy resolver used by the REST API and remote-download client. If you
    drive downloads through the API and need Windscribe
    or Gluetun exits, resolve the proxy on the CLI side or use a different provider for API
    jobs. See the developer note below.

## Developer notes

!!! note "Two resolution paths (developers)"
    evied has **two** proxy-resolution code paths that are intentionally not
    identical:

    - `evied/commands/dl.py` inlines its own logic and loads **all eight** providers,
      including Windscribe and Gluetun.
    - `evied/core/proxies/resolve.py::initialize_proxy_providers()` is the shared
      resolver used by the REST API handlers and the remote-service client. It **omits**
      Windscribe and Gluetun.

    Both paths accept the same query grammar (a direct URI, a `provider:query`, or a bare
    country query tried against providers in order), but the set of available providers
    differs. Keep this in mind when adding a provider: wiring it into `dl.py` does not make
    it available over the API, and vice versa.

!!! note "Implementing a new provider (developers)"
    Every provider subclasses `evied.core.proxies.proxy.Proxy` and implements three
    methods:

    - `__init__(self, **kwargs)` receives its `proxy_providers` sub-dict splatted as
      keyword arguments, so YAML keys map 1:1 to constructor parameters. Do authentication
      and catalog pre-fetching here.
    - `__repr__(self)` is a human summary, conventionally `"{n} Countries ({m} Servers)"`.
    - `get_proxy(self, query)` returns a Requests-compatible proxy URI, or `None` only
      when the query was valid but no proxy exists. Raise on genuine errors or bad queries.

    Optionally expose `get_connection_info(query)` (as Gluetun does) or
    `last_connection_display()` (as ExpressVPN and Proton VPN do) to have `dl` print a
    friendly connection line instead of the raw proxy URL.
