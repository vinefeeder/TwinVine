# The Configuration File

Almost everything about how evied behaves is controlled by a single YAML file named `evied.yaml`: where it saves downloads, which CDM it uses, your credentials, proxies, filename templates, and more. This page covers where that file lives, how evied finds it, the shape of its contents, the directory layout evied builds around it, and how to edit values from the command line.

!!! note "Where the exhaustive key list lives"
    This page is an overview. For the complete, key-by-key breakdown of every setting, its type, and its default, see the [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.md).

## The config filename

The main configuration file is always named `evied.yaml`. It is a plain YAML file. You can open and edit it in any text editor, or manage individual values with the [`evied cfg`](#editing-the-config-with-evied-cfg) command.

If you have never created one, that is fine: evied runs entirely on built-in defaults when no config file exists. The file only needs to contain the keys you want to change from their defaults.

## Where the config file lives

When evied starts, it searches a fixed list of locations and uses the **first one that exists**. In order of priority:

| # | Location | Typical path |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | The evied package folder | `.../site-packages/evied/evied.yaml` |
| 2 | The parent of the package folder | `.../site-packages/evied.yaml` |
| 3 | Your OS user-config directory | see the table below |

The third location, your per-user config directory, is the recommended place for most installations, because it lives outside the package and survives reinstalls and upgrades. Its exact path depends on your operating system:

=== "Linux"

    ```text
    ~/.config/evied/evied.yaml
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```text
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\evied\evied.yaml
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```text
    ~/Library/Application Support/evied/evied.yaml
    ```

!!! tip "Not sure which file is being used?"
    Run `evied env info`. It prints the path the config was loaded from (or tells you none was found), along with every directory evied is currently using.

The config is read exactly once, when evied starts. If you edit the file, the change takes effect on the next command you run.

## Top-level structure

`evied.yaml` is a flat map of top-level keys. Each key configures one area of the program. You only include the keys you want to change; everything else falls back to its default.

Here is a small, realistic example that sets a download location, a release tag, a default CDM, and one service's credentials:

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
# Where finished downloads are written
directories:
  downloads: ~/Videos/evied

# Release group tag appended to filenames
tag: MYGRP

# Default Widevine/PlayReady device to use, with per-service overrides
cdm:
  default: my_device_l3
  EXAMPLE: my_device_l1

# Per-service login details (service tag -> "username:password")
credentials:
  EXAMPLE: my_email@example.com:hunter2

# Default HTTP headers merged into every request
headers:
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
```

The top-level keys group loosely into these areas:

| Area | Example keys |
|------|--------------|
| Downloading & DRM | `dl`, `cdm`, `remote_cdm`, `decryption` |
| Networking | `network`, `headers` |
| Credentials & cookies | `credentials`, `firefox_cookies` |
| Tracks & muxing | `subtitle`, `audio`, `muxing`, `language_tags` |
| Key vaults | `key_vaults`, `vault_timeout` |
| Proxies & remote | `proxy_providers`, `remote_services`, `serve`, `services` |
| Naming & tagging | `tag`, `output_template`, `chapter_fallback_name` |
| External API keys | `tmdb_api_key`, `simkl_client_id`, `ipinfo_api_key` |
| Behavior & logging | `update_checks`, `redact_paths`, `debug`, `unicode_filenames` |
| Paths | `directories`, `filenames` |

For the full list with types and defaults, see the [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.md).

!!! warning "Unknown keys are silently ignored"
    evied does not validate your config against a schema. If you misspell a key, it is simply skipped and the default is used. You will not get an error. Double-check key names (and their nesting) if a setting does not seem to apply.

## Setting download defaults (`dl:`)

If you always pass the same `dl` flags (a language, a resolution, a codec), put them under a
`dl:` key once and evied applies them to every download. Any flag from
[Downloading](../guide/downloading.md) works here; the key is the flag's long name with dashes
turned into underscores (`--best-available` → `best_available`).

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
dl:
  lang: [en]          # -l en
  quality: [1080]     # -q 1080
  vcodec: [H.265]     # -v H.265
  sub_format: srt     # convert subtitles to SRT
  downloads: 2        # two tracks at once
```

You can still override any of these on the command line for a one-off; an explicit flag
always beats the config default. You can also scope defaults to a single service by nesting a
`dl:` block under it:

```yaml title="Per-service defaults"
dl:
  lang: [en]          # default for everything
services:
  EXAMPLE:
    dl:
      lang: [en, ja]  # Example downloads English + Japanese
```

!!! tip "A few keys are named after the flag's internal name"
    Most keys are obvious, but set these exact ones: `range` (`-r`), `list` (`--list`),
    `tmdb_id` (`--tmdb`), `imdb_id` (`--imdb`), `no_atmos` (`--noatmos`), and `output_dir`
    (`-o`). The [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.md#dl) has the full list
    and every available key.

## The directory layout

The `directories` key controls where evied reads and writes its various files. Each directory has a sensible default, and you can override most of them by giving a new path. Paths support `~` for your home directory.

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
directories:
  downloads: ~/Videos/evied
  temp: /mnt/fast/evied-temp
  cache: ~/.cache/evied
```

The directories evied uses:

| Name | Purpose | Overridable |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `downloads` | Default output folder for finished downloads | Yes |
| `temp` | Temporary working files during a download | Yes |
| `cache` | Cache store (title cache, update checks, service caches) | Yes |
| `cookies` | Per-service cookie files | Yes |
| `logs` | Log files | Yes |
| `exports` | Export JSONs | Yes |
| `wvds` | Widevine devices (`.wvd` files) | Yes |
| `prds` | PlayReady devices (`.prd` files) | Yes |
| `dcsl` | DCSL data | Yes |
| `services` | Search paths for service code (see below) | Yes |
| `commands` | CLI command modules | Yes |
| `vaults` | Vault modules | Yes |
| `fonts` | Bundled fonts | Yes |

!!! note "Some directories cannot be moved"
    evied protects five internal entries: `app_dirs`, `core_dir`, `namespace_dir`, `user_configs`, and `data`. If you list any of them under `directories`, evied ignores the override. This is intentional; those paths are tied to where the package is installed.

### The `services` directory is special

Unlike the other entries, `services` is a **list**, and each entry can be either a local folder or a remote repository. This lets you mix your own local service code with services pulled from Git:

```yaml title="evied.yaml"
directories:
  services:
    - you/your-services          # a GitHub owner/repo shorthand
    - https://example.com/private-services.git
    - ~/code/local-services      # a local folder
```

evied searches entries in the order listed, and **the first source to define a given service tag wins**, so put local folders last if you want them to act as fallbacks rather than overrides. evied clones remote repositories on first use and refreshes them at most once a day. See [Creating a Service](../dev/creating-a-service.md) for how service discovery and repositories work.

## The `filenames` key

Alongside `directories`, the `filenames` key lets you override the templates evied uses when naming its own working and log files (for example the log filename or the temporary chapters file). Most users never need to touch this. The available names and their default templates are listed in the [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.md#filenames).

## Editing the config with `evied cfg`

You do not have to edit `evied.yaml` by hand. The `evied cfg` command reads and writes individual values for you, creating the config file (and its parent directory) if it does not exist yet.

**Read a single value** by passing its key. Nested keys use dot notation:

```console
$ evied cfg tag
$ evied cfg cdm.default
```

**Set a value** by passing a key and a value:

```console
$ evied cfg tag MYGRP
$ evied cfg cdm.default my_device_l3
```

evied parses the value as a Python literal, so write booleans as `True`/`False` and quote the strings inside a list (`"['en']"`). Anything that is not valid Python literal syntax is stored as a plain string:

```console
$ evied cfg update_checks False
$ evied cfg vault_timeout 30
```

**Remove a value** with `--unset`:

```console
$ evied cfg cdm.default --unset
```

**List everything** currently set with `--list`:

```console
$ evied cfg --list
```

When it writes, `evied cfg` targets the config file that was loaded. If none exists yet, it creates `evied.yaml` inside the `evied` package folder (search location 1), not your OS user-config directory. To keep the config outside the package, create the file at the user-config path yourself first, then `evied cfg` writes to it.

!!! warning "Editing with `cfg` strips comments"
    Because `evied cfg` rewrites the whole file when it saves, any comments in `evied.yaml` are removed by a write. If you keep important notes as comments, edit the file by hand instead, or keep those notes elsewhere.
