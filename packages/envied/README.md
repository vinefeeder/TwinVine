## What is envied?

Envied is a fork of [Devine](https://github.com/devine-dl/devine/). The name 'envied' is an anagram of Devine, and as such, pays homage to the original author. 
Is is based on v 1.4.3 of envied. It is a powerful archival tool for downloading movies, TV shows, and music from streaming services. Built with a focus on modularity and extensibility, it provides a robust framework for content acquisition with support for DRM-protected content.

No commands have been changed 'uv run envied' still works as usual. 

The major difference is that envied comes complete and needs little configuration.
CDM and services are taken care of.
The prime reason for the existence of envied is a --select-titles function.

If you already use envied you'll probably just want to replace envied/envied/envied.yaml
with your own. But the exisiting yaml is close to working - just needs a few directory locations.


 **Recommended:** Use `uv run envied` instead of direct command execution to ensure proper virtual environment activation.


### Basic Usage

```shell


# Download content (requires configured services)
# from inside the TwinVine top level folder:-
uv run envied dl SERVICE_NAME CONTENT_ID
```
