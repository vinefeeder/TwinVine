        It does not get the content key by PSSH, as the PSSH can be different depending on its
        implementation, or even on how it was made. Some PSSH values can also be a CENC
        Header rather than a PSSH MP4 Box, which makes the value even more confusingly different.

        However, the KID never changes unless the video file itself has changed too, meaning the
        content key for the presumed-matching KID would not work, further proving matching by KID
        is superior.
